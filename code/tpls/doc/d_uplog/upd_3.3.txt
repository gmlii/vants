#mlang#MultiLanguage

* Concept multi language
 - In v3.2, just the concept for multi language;
 - in fact, It's just simplified Chinese, there is no actual multi language package;

* World needs
 - In v3.3, we put the code on github.com, feeling only the Chinese version is not for internationalization, so increase the English language package;
 - On one hand, a full English version of the display is so urgent needs for `non Chinese language users`;
 - On the other hand, increase multi language package is time-consuming and laborious, bloated complicated a lot, It's contrary to the system ` simple / lightweight ` 's philosophy;
 - One side is worried, and one side is to encourage myself(meanwhile i yearning for the English version), do it go on......

* Basic target:
 - Admin Center / Member Center / setup: can be switched in English and chinese;
 - Pages in chn.php : Demo the function in Chinese;  
  　　 Pages in dev.php : Chinese documents;  
  　　 Pages in mob.php : Demo the function in Mobile;
 - Add: doc.php, used as an English document;
 - Data in DB, with the installation, the choice of language, Chinese or English, can not be converted after insralled

* Please provide translation help:
 - The current English language package, some of the information is not thorough, or not very appropriate, need to improve or fix them;
 - If you are convenient, you can: provide translation help, see: Help >> Translation Notes;
 - If you know other languages, you can also: provide more other language package, thank you first!
